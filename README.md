sigbak
======

[sigbak][1] is a utility to read the encrypted backups created by the [Signal
messaging app][2]. It can be used to extract messages, attachments and other
data.

Documentation is available in the `sigbak.1` manual page. It is also [available
online][3].

Dependencies
------------

sigbak depends on libcrypto (from either [LibreSSL][4] or [OpenSSL][5]),
[protobuf-c][6] and [SQLite][7]. A C compiler, `make` and `pkg-config` are also
needed.

On Debian-based distros it should suffice to install the following packages:
build-essential libprotobuf-c-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev pkg-config
protobuf-c-compiler.

Building on OpenBSD
-------------------

To build sigbak on OpenBSD, run `make` and optionally `make install`.

Building on other systems
-------------------------

To build sigbak on other systems, first check out the `portable` branch:

	$ git checkout portable

Then check if `config.h` is suited to your system. Edit it if necessary.
`config.h` already has support for several systems. On those systems, no
editing should be necessary.

Finally, run `make` and optionally `make install`.

If you are unsure what to do with `config.h`, then leave it as is and just run
`make`. It is likely to work fine.
